        "\n",
        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages ?\n",
        "  - Interpreted Languages\n",
        "      - Execution: Code is executed line by line by an interpreter.\n",
        "      - Speed: Slower because execution happens at runtime.\n",
        "      - Error Handling: Stops execution at the first error.\n",
        "      - Portability: More portable since the interpreter runs on different platforms.\n",
        "      - Examples: Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby.\n",
        "  - Compiled Languages\n",
        "      - Execution: Code is converted into machine code before execution.\n",
        "      - Speed: Faster since it runs as native machine code.\n",
        "      - Error Handling: All errors must be fixed before execution.\n",
        "      - Portability: Less portable; needs recompilation for different platforms.\n",
        "      - Examples: C, C++, Java (compiles to bytecode), Go.\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python ?\n",
        "  - Exception handling in Python is a way to handle runtime errors (exceptions) gracefully without crashing the program.\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling ?\n",
        "   - The finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It ensures that necessary cleanup operations, like closing files or releasing resources, are always performed.\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "  - Logging in Python is used to record events, errors, and other information about a programâ€™s execution. It helps in debugging and monitoring applications.\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __del__ method is a destructor in Python. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected). This method is useful for cleaning up resources like closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting from databases.\n",
