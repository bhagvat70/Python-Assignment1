        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language designed for simplicity and readability.\n",
        "   - It supports multiple programming paradigms, including:\n",
        "       Object-Oriented Programming (OOP),\n",
        "       Procedural Programming,\n",
        "       Functional Programming.\n",
        "   - Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and emphasizes code readability with its clean syntax and use of indentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "   * why python is popular :->\n",
        "    i) Easy to use & learning\n",
        "    ii) Versatility\n",
        "    iii) A lot of libraries in python\n",
        "    iv) Strong community support.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  - An interpreter in Python is a software program that executes Python code line by line. It translates the high-level Python code into machine code that the computer can understand and execute, without the need for prior compilation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - false\n",
        "  - class\n",
        "  - none\n",
        "  - true\n",
        "  - and\n",
        "  - as\n",
        "  - assert\n",
        "  - async\n",
        "  - await\n",
        "  - break\n",
        "  - continue\n",
        "  - def\n",
        "  - del\n",
        "  - elif\n",
        "  - else\n",
        "  - expect\n",
        "  - finally\n",

        "  - with\n",
        "  - yield\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names. Keywords are reserved by the Python language for specific functionality, and using them as variable names would cause a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "  - Mutability refers to the ability of an object to be modified after it is created. In Python, objects can be classified into mutable and immutable types based on whether their values can be changed or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "  - Lists Are Mutable:\n",
        "    - Purpose: Lists are designed to be flexible and dynamic containers that  allow modification of their contents.\n",
        "    - Use Case: Lists are useful when you need to perform operations like adding, removing, or updating elements over time, which requires the ability to modify the contents.\n",
        "  - Tuples Are Immutable:\n",
        "    - Purpose: Tuples are designed to represent fixed collections of items that should not be altered once they are created.\n",
        "    - Use Case: Tuples are suitable for representing data that should remain constant, like coordinates, configuration settings, or records that shouldn’t change.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "  - == (Equality Operator)\n",
        "    - Purpose: The == operator checks if the values of two objects are equal.\n",
        "    - What It Compares: It compares the contents or values of the objects.\n",
        "    - Use Case: Use == when you want to check if two objects have the same value, even if they are different objects in memory.\n",
        "  - is (Identity Operator)\n",
        "    - Purpose: The is operator checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory (i.e., whether they have the same identity).\n",
        "    - What It Compares: It compares the memory address or identity of the objects.\n",
        "    - Use Case: Use is when you want to check if two variables point to the same object in memory, not just if their values are equal.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
        "  - and: Checking if multiple conditions are true.\n",
        "  - or: Checking if at least one condition is true.\n",
        "  - not: Negating a condition.  \n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "  - Type casting refers to converting one data type into another. Python provides two types of type casting:\n",
        "    - Implicit Type Casting (Automatic Casting)\n",
        "    - Explicit Type Casting (Manual Casting)\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  - Implicit Type Casting\n",
        "    - Definition : Python automatically converts one data type to another.\n",
        "    - When It Occurs : Occurs automatically when a smaller data type is converted to a larger one (e.g., int to float).\n",
        "    - Type of Conversion :Converts from a smaller type to a larger type (e.g., integer to float).\n",
        "    - Example : x = 5 (int) and y = 2.5 (float); x + y results in 7.5 (float).\n",
        "  -  Explicit Type Casting\n",
        "    - Definition : The programmer manually converts one data type to another using built-in functions.\n",
        "    - When It Occurs : Occurs when the programmer decides to convert a value to another data type.\n",
        "    - Type of Conversion : Converts between any types as per user requirements, including narrowing conversions (e.g., float to int).\n",
        "    - Example : x = 7.8; y = int(x) results in 7 (int).x = 7.8; y = int(x) results in 7 (int).\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "  - Conditional statements in Python are used to execute specific blocks of code based on whether a given condition is True or False. They allow for decision-making, flow control, error handaling & implementing logic in programs, enabling the program to react differently based on various inputs or conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  - The program first evaluates the if condition.\n",
        "      - If the if condition is True, its associated block is executed, and the rest of the elif and else blocks are skipped.\n",
        "      - If the if condition is False, the program proceeds to evaluate the elif conditions in order.\n",
        "  - The program checks each elif condition one by one.\n",
        "      - If any elif condition is True, its corresponding block is executed, and the rest of the conditions are ignored.\n",
        "  - If all if and elif conditions are False, the else block (if present) will be executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "    - For loop\n",
        "        - Purpose : Used for iterating over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string, etc.) or a range of values.\n",
        "        - Termination : Automatically terminates when the sequence ends or the loop completes all iterations.\n",
        "        - Condition Type :Iterates over a sequence of values (like list or range).\n",
        "        - Use Case : Used when the number of iterations is known in advance or based on a sequence.\n",
        "        - Loop Control :\tCan use break, continue, and else (after completing the loop).\n",
        "    - While loop\n",
        "        - Purpose : Used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is True.\n",
        "        - Termination : Terminates when the condition becomes False.\n",
        "        - Condition Type : Continues until the condition evaluates to False.\n",
        "        - Use Case : Used when the number of iterations is unknown, and the loop continues based on a condition.\n",
        "        - Loop Control : Can use break, continue, and else (after exiting the loop).\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "  - Scenario: User Input Validation\n",
        "      - A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known in advance and the loop needs to continue executing until a certain condition is met.\n"
